# Introduction

We were given a problem to locate a facility given a set of candidates towns.
The available dataset contains the population of each city and its coordinates
allowing us to find the distances between them. The goal is to decide how many
distribution centres to allocate constrained by a certain budget.

# Question 1

Question data:

Name                                    | Description
----------------------------------------|-------------------------
$$ City $$                              | set of cities
$$ latitude_{c}, c \in City $$          | cities' latitudes
$$ longitude_{c}, c \in City $$         | cities' longitudes
$$ population_{c}, c \in City $$        | cities' population
$$ R $$                                 | earth radius (km)
$$ yearly_cost $$                       | yearly cost of opening a Distribution Centre
